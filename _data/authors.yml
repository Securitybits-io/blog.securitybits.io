  bio: I am Christoffer Claesson, a professional security researcher from Sweden who spends his days (and many nights) on red teaming, security deep dives, and homelab experiments. This blog is my way of giving back to the community by sharing lessons, notes, and the occasional side project that grew bigger than planned.
