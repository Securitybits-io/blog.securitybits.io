This article demonstrates how to use cover images in the Tranquilpeak theme. Cover images are displayed prominently at the top of blog posts and can create a beautiful visual impact.

## What are cover images?

Cover images are featured images that appear at the top of your blog posts. They can be set using the `coverimage` parameter in your post's front matter, or by using the `photos` array for image galleries.

## Setting a cover image

To set a cover image for your post, add the `coverimage` parameter to your front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
coverimage: "https://example.com/image.jpg"
---
```

## Image galleries

You can also create image galleries by using the `photos` array:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
photos:
  - "https://example.com/image1.jpg"
  - "https://example.com/image2.jpg"
  - "https://example.com/image3.jpg"
---
```

## Best practices

1. **Use high-quality images**: Choose images that are at least 800x600 pixels
2. **Optimize for web**: Compress images to reduce loading times
3. **Choose relevant images**: Select images that relate to your content
4. **Consider aspect ratios**: The theme works best with landscape-oriented images

## Responsive behavior

The cover images are fully responsive and will look great on all devices:

- **Desktop**: Full-width display with optimal quality
- **Tablet**: Scaled appropriately for medium screens
- **Mobile**: Optimized for small screens with touch-friendly interactions

## Examples

Here are some examples of beautiful cover images you can use:
